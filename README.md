## Additional Information

- **React & Tailwind CSS:** The project uses React for building the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom CSS can be found in `App.css` and `index.css`.
- **Icons:** Icons used are from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), the website favicon was generated by ChatGPT and modified in Figma.
- **Helper Script:** The `compile_dir.py` script helps in generating a Markdown file (`output.md`) that contains the repository structure and source code. This can be useful for pasting the entire codebase into an AI to have it code for you.
