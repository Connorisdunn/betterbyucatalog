# BYU Course Catalog

### CS 356, Group 4

A React-based course catalog application for BYU courses. This project allows users to filter and search for courses by various criteria, such as semester, department, days taught, and type of class. It also features a dynamic dropdown component, keyword highlighting in search results, and more. More to come!

## TODO

- [] The mobile page and the layout for smaller monitors need to be adjusted(course cards needs to be shown).
- [] Make the filter section narrower.
- [] Enable filtering by clicking on the class types(once the courses.js is fixed, this should search through the sections).
- [c] Add a link to MyMap.
- [x] Make the Pinned courses clickable so you can retrieve them easily to the Featured Class section
- [x] Make the department and interests dropdowns clickable
- [x] Make the (0 selected) on filters show under the dropdown, not on the dropdown
- [x] Change Semester selection to a dropdown? Or do we like it like this?
- [x] Improve the page layout - too much vertical gap between classes, etc.
- [ ] Make the Featured Card look nicer (more gray desc. text, icons instead of text, etc)
- [] Refine the courses.js data (e.g. we don't want "days", "type", or "Semesters" attributes, those depend on the sections not on the course itself)
- [ ] Fix the days taught filter (same deal, we have to look through the sections of the classes)
- [x] Move the "Displaying x of y" text to under the Filters title, change it to "X classes match your filters. (The other Y are hidden)"
- [ ] Make the featured class card have a max height and scroll internally
- [ ] Have the featured class only show sections from the selected semester
- [ ] Show more on a class card?
- [ ] Include major requirements?
- [ ] What else...
- [x] Change Header, bump search bar and mymap up to header
- [x] Edit the expanded course so you can pin it as well

## Additional Information

- **React & Tailwind CSS:** The project uses React for building the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom CSS can be found in `App.css` and `index.css`.
- **Icons:** Icons used are from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), the website favicon was generated by ChatGPT and modified in Figma.
- **Helper Script:** The `compile_dir.py` script helps in generating a Markdown file (`output.md`) that contains the repository structure and source code. This can be useful for pasting the entire codebase into an AI to have it code for you.
