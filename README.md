# BYU Course Catalog

### CS 356, Group 4

A React-based course catalog application for BYU courses. This project allows users to filter and search for courses by various criteria, such as semester, department, days taught, and type of class. It also features a dynamic dropdown component, keyword highlighting in search results, and more. More to come!

## TODO

- [ ] Make the Pinned courses clickable so you can retrieve them easily to the Featured Class section
- [ ] Move the "Displaying x of y" text to under the Filters title, change it to "X classes match your filters. (The other Y are hidden)"
- [ ] Make the featured class card have a max height and scroll internally
- [ ] Have the featured class only show sections from the selected semester
- [ ] Make sure there is only one scroll bar (for the classes). Two (for the whole site) are annoying.
- [ ] Whenever you click on a class have it open the featured section.
- [ ] Add text to the featured class when it's closed: (Click here to open), when it's open: (Click here to minimize)
- [ ] Show somewhere what the stars mean (on mouse hover?)
- [ ] Make the (0 selected) on filters show under the dropdown, not on the dropdown
- [ ] Fix online filter (it should search the sections, doesn't seem to be working)
- [ ] Show more on a class card?
- [ ] Include major requirements?
- [ ] What else...

## Additional Information

- **React & Tailwind CSS:** The project uses React for building the UI and Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom CSS can be found in `App.css` and `index.css`.
- **Icons:** Icons used are from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/), the website favicon was generated by ChatGPT and modified in Figma.
- **Helper Script:** The `compile_dir.py` script helps in generating a Markdown file (`output.md`) that contains the repository structure and source code. This can be useful for pasting the entire codebase into an AI to have it code for you.
